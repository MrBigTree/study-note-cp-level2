- A relation is NOT a table that has special restrictions on it.

- A primary key is a group of one or more columns that uniquely identifies a row.

- A functional dependency is a relationship between attributes such that if we know the value of one attribute, we can determine the value of the other attribute.
- If by knowing the value of A we can find the value of B, then we would say that B is functionally dependent on A.

- In functional dependencies, the attribute whose value is known or given is referred to as the determinant.
